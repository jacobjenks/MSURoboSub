I'm just going to put notes in this file on how to do various things
so I don't have to rediscover how to do it every time.

To install ROS packages:
	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-{package-name}

To build ROS:
	Switch to ros directory
	catkin_make

To make it so ROS can find our package:
	Add the following line to the end of ~/.bashrc
	source ~/MSURoboSub/ros/devel/setup.bash

To start ROS:
	roscore

To run an individual node:
	rosrun msurobosub <Node>.py

To add a new message type:
	Add to CMakeLists in msurobosub package

To rebuild Arduino libraries:
	//wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino IDE Setup
	cd ~/Arduino/libraries/
	rm -rf ros_lib
	rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

Dependencies that need to be installed separately:
	#ArduinoJson
	ros-indigo-keyboard
	ros-indigo-rosserial
	ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino
	ros-indigo-robot-localization
	pyserial
